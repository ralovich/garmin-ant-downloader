.SH "NAME"
garmin-ant-downloader \- console based ANT+ information retrieval client for Garmin GPS products
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "garmin-ant-downloader [ " "OPTIONS" " ] "
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "garmin-ant-downloader"
is a small command-line utility to retrieve information (sports
tracks, etc.) from Garmin GPS products over the wireless ANT/ANT+
protocols. Currently supported devices are the Forerunner 405.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI "\-a " "authfile"
Provide authfile (default ~/.gant).

.SS "Help options"
.TP
.BI "\-h"

.SH "EXAMPLE 1"
Put 405 in pairing mode
./gant -f paul -a auth405

This gives your garmin a name of "paul" and an auth file of "auth405"
The 405 will ask you if you wish to pair with "paul". Obviously
you might want to use a different name :)

Download with:
./gant -nza auth405 > output

or -Dnza if you want lots of debug output

It doesn't seem to be very reliable at starting the download and
I haven't investigated why yet. So, if it doesn't start downloading
press ctrl-c and try again. I find it helps to take the watch out
of power save mode.

If you've already downloaded the data, then you'll need to set
"force send" to yes on the watch.

Compare output with .TCX file produce by windows ANT Agent.
.SH "EXAMPLE 2"
	HOWTO USE garmin-ant-downloader

1. plugin your ANT+ stick
2. the system will load the kernel module "cp210x"
3. to find out what ttyUSB device is used run
.LP
.RS
# dmesg|grep "cp210x converter"
.RE
.RS
[...] cp210x 3-1:1.0: cp210x converter detected
.RE
.RS
[...] usb 3-1: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB3
.RE
.LP
In this case you have to use the optione "-d 3". If it is
ttyUSB0 then you don't need the -d option because 0 is the
default
4. put the watch into paring mode (menu -> configuration -> ANT+ ->
   computer -> pairing on)
5. pair the computer with the watch ("mywatch" as name for the watch and
   the file "auth405" as an authorization file which will be created)
.LP
.RS
# garmin-ant-downloader -d 3 -f mywatch -a auth405
.RE
.LP
6. download saved tracks from the watch
.LP
.RS
# garmin-ant-downloader -d 3 -f mywatch -nza auth405
.RE
.LP
You get the possible options with
.LP
.RS
# garmin-ant-downloader -h
.RE
.LP
To convert the downloaded TCX file (e.g. 2011-07-22-123456.tcx) you can use gpsbabel:
.LP
.RS
# gpsbabel -t -i gtrnctr -f 2011-07-22-123456.tcx -o gpx -F 2011-07-22-123456.gpx

.SH "DEVICES"
Wireless ANT communications happens over a USB2ANT dongle. Under Linux
the dongle is driven by
.B cp210x
kernel module, and presented to user-space as a USB serial port,
.B /dev/ttyUSBxxx
where
.B xxx
is an integer. The dongle is typically carrying the USB vendor id/product id
pair of 0fcf/1004 or 0fcf/1008. Recent Linux systems employ
.B udev
to handle device nodes and permissions, thus appropriate
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/lib/modules/`uname \-r`/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.ko\fR
Kernel driver module for USB2ANT dongle.
.TP
.B /dev/ttyUSBxxx
Serial device created for dongle.
.TP
.B $HOME/.gant
Default authentication file.
